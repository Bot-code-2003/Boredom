3. Margins & Paddings
   Section Padding:
   Padding inside section: px-4 py-12 on smaller screens, sm:px-8 on larger screens
   For consistency, use px-4 (horizontal) and py-12 (vertical) as your base padding across sections, and increase to px-8 on larger screens for more space.
   Heading Margin:
   Bottom margin (mb-6): Keeps space between heading and next element
   Body Text Margin:
   Bottom margin (mb-6): Maintains spacing between body text and the button or image
   Image Margin:
   Bottom margin (mb-8): Ensures the image has space before the button
   Button Padding:
   Padding: px-6 py-3 for consistent sizing and clickability
   Use similar padding for all buttons across your site for uniformity.
4. Spacing (Gaps)
   Gaps Between Items:
   gap-5 or gap-6: Space between elements in flexbox or grid layout
   Use gap-5 for smaller spaces and gap-6 for larger, balanced gaps between content sections.
5. Borders & Effects
   Button Borders:
   Rounded corners: rounded-lg (for all buttons and containers)
   Image Borders:
   Rounded corners: rounded-lg
   Shadows:
   Image and Button Shadows: shadow-lg to elevate the button and image slightly off the page
   Hover States:
   Smooth transition: transition duration-300 for hover effects on buttons (hover state changes like color gradients should animate over 300ms for a smooth effect)
6. General Layout (Flex/Grid)
   Flexbox for Layout:
   flex flex-col items-center text-center: Centers text and content within sections.
   Use items-center to align content centrally in both horizontal and vertical layouts.
   Grid Layout:
   For multiple sections, such as cards or content blocks, use grid with gaps:
   grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6: Creates responsive grids that adapt to screen sizes.
7. Responsive Breakpoints
   Small Screens (Default):
   For smaller screens (mobile), use text-3xl for headings and text-md for body text.
   Use px-4 py-12 for spacing around content.
   Medium and Large Screens:
   For screens above 640px (tablet and larger), increase font sizes to sm:text-5xl for headings and sm:text-lg for body text.
   Use sm:px-8 for extra horizontal padding.
   Summary for Site-Wide Consistency
   Colors:
   Use gradients like yellow-orange for emphasis, teal/cyan for underlines, and indigo-purple for buttons to add variety.
   Spacing:
   Stick with px-4 py-12 padding for general sections and mb-6 or mb-8 for element margins.
   Text:
   Follow the size hierarchy: text-3xl/sm:text-5xl for headings, text-md/sm:text-lg for body text.
   Flex/Grid:
   Use flexbox for vertical layouts and grid for multiple columns with gap-5 or gap-6 for balanced spacing.
   Buttons & Hover:
   Use gradient buttons with hover effects (from-indigo-500 to-purple-500), rounded corners, and shadows.
